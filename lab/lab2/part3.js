# Lab 2, Part 3 â€” Underscore Analyze

## Introduction

Let's revisit the bike share data from Week 2 Lab 1, Part 4. Remember, each array contains the following:

1. lng
2. lat
3. label
4. number of bike share docks at the station

## Task 1

We're especially interested in number 4: number of bike share docks at the station.

Using underscore functions, generate a list of all bike share docks that are greater than 20. One way to do this is by using _.filter, but you can try other solutions as well. Set your answer to variable "largeStationList".

## Task 2

Let's say we only care about the final count of bike share locations with more than 20 docks. Calculate the value by using _.countBy and set your answer to variable "largeStationCount".
===================== */

var data = bikeArrayClean;

var largeStationList = _.filter(data, function(value)
{
  if (value[3]>20) {
    return value;
  }
});
console.log(largeStationList);


var count= _.countBy(data,function(value)
{
  return  value[3]>20;
});

var largeStationCount = count.true;
console.log(largeStationCount);
